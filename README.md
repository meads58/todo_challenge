Do you ever forget what key tasks need doing, would a list be handy to keep track of these need to do tasks?

If this is you then the toDo list is for you.

Setup
-----
* Run bower install
* Run npm install

Functionality
-----------
* Enter in an item to the list.
* Tasks can be checked off as completed.
* Tasks can be edited to update the task details.

Development Approach
-------------------
* Choose to develop the frontend with AngularJS, unit testing with karma and end2end testing with Protractor becasue I wanted to a better understanding of AngularJS and I like the Protractor end2end testing tool.
* Installed all the dependency files with bower and npm and updated the .gitignore file.


Issues
------
* Cannot work out how to configure the travis.yml file to run krama tests. Followed the karma site instructions and various other suggestions
